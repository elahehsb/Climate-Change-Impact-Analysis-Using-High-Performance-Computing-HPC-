# Climate-Change-Impact-Analysis-Using-High-Performance-Computing-HPC-
##### Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of climate change on various environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, and sea levels. The project involves collecting large-scale climate data from various sources, processing and analyzing the data using high-performance computing (HPC) resources, developing predictive models, and visualizing the results through an interactive dashboard. This project will aid in understanding the potential impacts of climate change and inform policy decisions.

##### System Architecture
Components:

###### Data Collection: Gather climate data from public repositories such as NASA, NOAA, and IPCC.
###### Data Storage: Use HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for storing and managing large datasets.
###### Data Processing: Utilize Apache Spark for data processing and analysis.
###### Machine Learning: Develop machine learning models for climate prediction.
###### Visualization: Create an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash for data visualization and result interpretation.
###### Deployment: Employ Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.
